            <p>Human beings keep on looking for satisfaction, happiness, and tranquility and usually try to dodge everything full of darkness, despair, and sadness. However, this is not the case all the time. Everyone has to go through a lot of uninvited sorrows, sadness, and sufferings. A lot of problems, distress, and adversity create a lot of fuss in life. The reason behind this suffering could be 'Karma or past action.' It is true that traditional Astrology is dependent on the authentic philosophy of 'KARMA..' The positioning, period, and power of the planets in the horoscope does not appear to be a candid arrangement or circumstantial fusion. It eventually reflects past deeds or Karma. The good Karma will appear in benefic planets while it is the malefic planet, which signifies the Negative Karma. There are planets, and it can be categorized into three important categories here, such as benefic, malefic, and neutral. None of the planets is positive or negative on its own. It is the positioning, placement, and condition that plays a vital part that appears to be a deciding factor for native whether it is going to be advantageous or disastrous for native. Many times the Benefic Planets appear to be extremely fragile, and so it needs to be empowered, the reason behind doing this will be to give effective and impactful plus optimistic outcomes. However, the malefic planet needs to be pacified in order to decrease its pessimistic results. The exclusivity of Vedic Astrology is that it brings out an entire collection of remedies to secure the weak benefic planets and to appease the malefic ones. </p>
            <h2>Why do Remedies work?</h2>
            <p>Remedies are eventually nothing empirical, mystical, and metaphysical remedy which eventually minimizes or invalidate the deeds or negative impact of past due to Karma. The fortune is constructed by the past Karmic Cycles. Solutions or Remedies do help an individual to proceed or abstain from doing something. Even this particular action or inactivity appears to be Karma in itself.</p>
            <p>So, when anyone begins to proceed with any remedy, one tries best to nullify the bad deeds done in the past. However, when an individual tries to empower the weak benefic planets, one is trying to escalate the effectiveness by proceeding with doing good Karma. The fortune is decided by KARMA. However, you can enjoy your liberty to proceed and take any remedial measures.</p>
            <h2>Astrological Remedies can be broadly classified as follows:</h2>
            <p><b>1. Mantras: </b></p>
            <p>There are classic Sanskrit Mantras, which are energy-based sounds that ensure various vibrational and reverberating potential. All the Mantras are associated with a specific planet or even appear to be immortal representatives of that planet and chant different Mantras which are powerful. Also, Mantra Chanting is also known as 'JAPA.'</p>
            <p><b>2. Yantra:</b></p>
            <p>Yantras appear to be Geometrical and Mathematical Graphics, Signs, symbols, and drawings. However, all the signs, symbols, and everything must have specific measurements. Even Yantras resonate with different energies and vibes in a different way. The planetary Yantras must be positioned in the right direction as then only it will give out constructive and optimistic energy. It is immensely helpful in eradicating negativity and pessimism from life.</p>
            <p><b>3. Remedial Products:</b></p>
            <p>The various empowered astrological remedies also include the usage of various products, including Gems, Rudraksha, Crystal, Charms, and Herbs. All of these products appear to be immensely helpful in removing negativity and inviting positivity. It also eradicates all the bad impacts of malefic planets.</p>
            <p><b>4. Service:</b></p>
            <p>It is considered to be another form of remedy, probably the best in Astrology. It is considered a kind of Charity, donation, or offering to the poor and needy in order to uplift them and their lifestyle. Different types of donations are referred to for different planets.</p>
            <p><b>5. Change of attitudes and habits:</b></p>
            <p>To improve your Karma, this appears to be the most effective and impactful remedy or way to enrich or enhance your Karma. With this, one can also rectify mistakes by developing great habits and a positive attitude. Due to placement, positioning, and alignment of planets, in the birth horoscope, many times, situations act adverse and create chaos.</p>
            <p>In this kind of circumstances, it is suggested that one should admire and follow good habits and give up on bad habits and attitudes, which is eventually the outcome of alignment or positioning. One must learn virtues and ethical principles. You must stay patient and give up all the bad qualities such as anger. Also, exclude eating salt or sugar.</p>
            <p><b>6. Fasting:</b></p>
            <p>As the name suggests, one has to stop oneself from consuming food or a few other things, which is your favorite. This voluntary restriction or sacrifice of any desire that makes you happy acts as a strong remedy to nullify the bad effects and empowers the planets' optimistic outcome. </p>
