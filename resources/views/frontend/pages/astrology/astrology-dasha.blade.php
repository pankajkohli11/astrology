            <p>The Sanskrit term "Dasha," Hindu astrology is used to advocate planetary durations. The planetary durations imply while the best or terrible results are produced consistent with their placement with the aid of using signal (Rasi), house (Bhava), combinations (Yogas or Raja Yogas), or aspects (Drishti). The Dasha Paddhati (machine) of Directional Astrology is precise to the Hindus; its miles located nowhere else. There are many sorts of Dasha systems. Parashara states forty-two of them, however of those handiest are in vogue, namely, "Vimshottari" and "Ashtottari." Dashas offer a machine to decide the planets' results during an individual's life, indicating how the planets distribute their results. Each Dasha is managed using one of the nine planets, and friendly and relative benevolence of every length is decided to use the circumstance and role of that planet withinside the natal chart. The nine planets or Grahas rule the nine Dashas. There are traditional and seven other classical planets, including the north node, Rahu, and the South Node, Ketu, of the Moon. There are, as a minimum, forty-three exclusive Dasha systems. "Dasha" is the critical length of a planet. It is referred to as the "Poorna Dasha" if the planet is the maximum effect or is in its signal of exaltation, which Dasha offers fitness and wealth; the Dasha of a powerless planet is referred to as the "Rikta Dasha," "Rikta" signifies terrible or without any power. Varahamihira describes the Dasha of the planet are settled unfriendly and unhealthy signals and symbols. Along with that, navamsa will produce Aristaphala, i.e., unwanted or depressing results; the planet that has fallen from elevation, however, is in pleasant or blissful navamsa offers expected results, and the planet this is ascending from weakness, however, is in weakening or unfriendly navamsa, and offers a worthless length.</p>
            <h2>Vimshottari Dasha</h2>
            <p>Vimshottari in Sanskrit states one hundred twenty. Vimshottari Dasha assumes that the most period of lifestyles of a character person is one hundred twenty years that is the mixture period of all nine planetary durations, i.e., Ketu seven, Venus twenty, Sun six, Moon ten, Mars seven, Rahu eighteen, Jupiter sixteen, Saturn nineteen and Mercury seventeen, withinside the order in their operation.</p>
            <h2>Significance of Moon</h2>
            <p>The divisional longitude of every one of the 27 nakshatras starting with Ashwini and finishing with Revati is thirteen stages, and 20 mins are classified into four various quarters or different Padas. Almost every one of the nine planets presides over a fix of 3 nakshatras located at the zodiac at a trine from every different. The starting up Dasha or Mahadasha at the time of Birth can be that of the lord of the Nakshatra wherein the Moon is placed, which specific Nakshatra is called the "Janma nakshatra." When Moon is in Taurus in Mrigsira, the primary or first Dasha can be of Mars, the second one can be that of Rahu, and so on. The distance already blanketed via way of means of the Moon in Mrigsira can be the part of the Dasha of Mars that has elapsed; the space but to be blanketed will constitute the part of the Dasha of Mars this is but to be experienced. The stability is calculated on the premise of the guideline of thumb of 3 handiest within the primary Mahadasha; the following Mahadashas could have their complete quota. The stability of Mahadasha at Birth on the premise of the precise longitude of the Moon may be ascertained via way of means of the usage of the equipped reckoner furnished in all Panchangas. The Antra-dashes or the sub-intervals and the Prayantra-dashes of every planet are calculated on pro-rata foundation in the share of the years allocated to them withinside the one hundred twenty years cycle of Vimshottari Dasha system. (5) : 253 Saravali signifies that the signal occupied via way of means of the Moon and the effects exercised on it via way of means of different planets through components etc.; on the time of the beginning of its Mahadasa need to be stated and examined, the identical precept needs to be implemented to different Mahadasa lords additionally. If on the time of the graduation of the Mahadasa its lord is withinside the Lagna or in benefic or pleasant Vargas or a Upachyasthana from the Birth ascendant or if the Moon occupies the pleasant signal or exaltation signal of the lord of the Mahadasa or is in a Upachyasthana from the Mahadasa lord and the Mahadasa lord is in a trine from the Moon then the Mahadasa will supply pretty precise results.[7] The order and instances of the Dashas or Mahadashas are proven withinside the following table.</p>

            <p><b>Implication</b></p>
            <p>The sign, the Navamsa, and the Nakshatra engaged via means of the Moon are of great significance; they shape the premise for predicting destiny events. All planets are rendered vulnerable while the Moon is without strength. The effects of approximately all astrological troubles are to be deduced from the applicable Bhava, its lord, its Karaka, and their respective dispositors withinside the mild of the intricacy displayed via means of the numerous yoga-formations as an outcome of involved planets. The appropriate or terrible effects of all yoga-formations are felt in the direction of the Mahadasha or Antra-Dashas of planets taking part in yoga-arrangement. According to their primary and purchased qualities, all planets deliver effects according to the quality and essence of the Nakshatra they dominate and rule.</p>
            <p>It is nearly impossible to overlook the wise positions of the planet and also the way Nakshatras are ruled by them. Henceforth, this drives attention to a classical and ancient principle popularly known as Jataka, Parijata, which is counted from the Janma Nakshatras. Along with that, the Dashas of the planet cover the first nine Nakshatras, which reflects the impacts of the past; from 10th to 18th Nakshatras, it denotes future, and from 19th to 27th Nakshatra brings out no result. The nine Nakshatras starts with the one occupied by the Moon just at Birth or Janma. "Janma," the "Sampata," the "Vipat," the "Kshema," "Pratayari," the "Sadhaka," "Vadha," the "Mitra" and the "Ati-Mitra" nakshatras are the various Dashas, and Antar-Dashas of the planets do occupy the Sampata (2nd), the Sadaka sixth, The Mitra eight, and the Param-Mitra ninth confer .wealth, etc.; the is fifth called the Uttpanna, the eighth the Adhana and the fourth the Maha nakshatra. Planets that rule friendly or favorable Nakshatras usually bring out excellent results only if they cover or occupy any favorable Nakshatra. The Nakshatras that are ruled are not burdened by planets that rule, critical or adverse Nakshatra.</p>
            <h2>Considerations in judging planetary periods</h2>
            <p>Vaidyanatha Dikshita, in his Jataka Parijata, says that a planet will give the best or extraordinary results if it is placed in the middle of the bhava engaged by it. The outcome will minimize the more it is far-away from the center, or if it has got more and more good bind us in the Sarva Ashtakavarga or if it involves the Lagna, the tenth or the eleventh house or it is elevated, in friendly Vargas or interests favorable bhavas in yoga with beneficial bhava-lords and karakas. The Mahadasa of the planet possesses the sign occupied by either Mandi or Gulika or, in conjunction with Mandi or acquiring very few advantageous Bindus or occupying its adversarial or degeneration sign or catch afflicted by papa-Grahas or in Rasi-sandhi or Bhava-sandhi or counter association with malefic will give poor results.</p>
            <p>The consequence of the planetary periods or dashes base on the particular strength or weakness of the pertained planet; for the planet to give its best results, it should be influential in Shadabala and auspiciously placed with authority to the Lagna without being agonized by hostile malefic planets. Saturn placed in the 5th house from the Lagna does not usually give away a good outcome, though it can provide a long span of life usually makes one devil-minded and argumentative. During the Gemini Lagna, Saturn, posited in the 5th, will signify glorification as profitable. As the almighty of the ninth house, it will give elevation to yoga and Dhana yoga. A rising planet occupying a Trikonabhava makes one lucky and popular. Along with that, if the god of the navamsa of occupation is also placed in a quadrant, which means Kendra or a trine, which means Trikona from the Lagna in own or advancement signals, then one undoubtedly becomes very lucky and occupies a noble position in life.</p>
            <p>All planets give their positive or negative results during the time of their Madrasas and antra-Dasas; the results will vary from native to native because of the varying conditions and situations of their births and family history, place, and even the country of Birth, and because planets are never found coequal in any two particular horoscopes. A planet may give a less powerful nature, but at the same time, it may also give consequences in monetary and professional affluence. The mental temperament is decided by reference to the Moon, and the disadvantage to diseases and mishaps is judged from the planets associating with the Moon, the Sun, and the Lagna.</p>
            <p>Jataka Parijata (Ch. XVIII. SI. 58) States that in the start, the Mahadasa god gives results by the house it occupies, in the middle, as per the sign it occupies, and at the end, as per the impact of the planetary view that improves the Mahadasa lord. And, Mantreswara in his Phaladeepika describes that the profit or loss of stuff and the occasions countered by a particular bhava will be proficient when the lord of the Lagna moves a triple from the natal position of the bhava-lord or the bhava-lord transits a trine from the natural point of the Lagna, or during of the period of their transits they contradict each other or combination in a sign, or when the bhava-karaka moves from the natural position of the almighty of the Lagna or the lord of the sign settled by the Moon during the time of Birth or when the Langa's Lord is transiting that bhava.</p>
