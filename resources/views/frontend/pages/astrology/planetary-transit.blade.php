            <p>Planetary transit is basically a technical term in Vedic Astrology. It simply means transit(movement) of planets in the constellation. These transit of planets have a significant role in human life and great impact on the astrology predictions. In this page, we will explain what is planetary transit. What is the importance of these planetary transits, when do planetary transit take place? How to know about these regular planet transits and how to take benefit knowing about planetary transit today(for the day). Many good astrology websites give information about all these questions about regualr planet transit in astrology. We are also explaining all this point by point.</p>
            <h2>Importance of Planetary Transit</h2>
            <p>Planetary transit today means the movement of planets from one to the other sign on regular time cycle. These regualr planet transits give ample flexibility to manoeuvre our karmas to mend the results if not changed 100% as deciphered in the original birth chart. All the nine planets are always moving, or by using a different word, we may say that all the planets are Transiting. This movement of planets is known as regualr planetary transits and in the Hindi language as “Gochar.” Vedic Astrology has sufficient tools to guide a person on the impact of all these transits at the beginning of the Year itself.</p>
            <p>According to Vedic Astrology, tregular planet transits chiefly known as Gochar in Indian astrology, are very important for becoming familiar with the planet's effects on a native at a particular time. A specific planet's transition means transit(movement) of that planet from one sign to another and one Nakshatra to another. When it has a connection with any Nakshatra, it shows some effects which can be benefic or malefic. If the effect is beneficial, then it brings positive changes in one's life. On the contrary, adverse effects bring in bad results.</p>
            <p>A planet can also become retrograde and combust, which are represented in the transit calendar. All the seven planets Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn alongwith two nodes Rahu and Ketu have different positions and transit's time on twelve zodiac signs. While, on the one hand, the planetary positions of Jupiter, Ketu, Rahu, and Saturn have long-lasting effects. On the other hand, transit of planets—Mercury and Moon—bring fast changes in one's life. Transit of planets and their influences are always thoroughly studied regarding native's natal chart. The chart of regular planet transits of all the planets is explained further down on this page.</p>
            <h2>When do Planet Transits take place?</h2>
            <p>Regular planet transits is a continuous process. The original Natal Chart of a person shows the sign wise position of the transiting planets at the time of birth. So the birth chart or the horoscope of a person sets up a broad road map of that person's life as each house of a birth chart relates to a specific area or aspect of life. All astrological indications in a Natal chart are probabilities, some strong and some weak. Right from birth, planetary periods or Dashas operate one after the other. There are many Dasha systems, but as per Maharishi Prashra, the Vimshotry Dasha System is preferable.</p>
            <h2>Planetary Transits and predictions</h2>
            <p>Do planetary transits affect predictions and if yes, how do the planet transits affect predictions? Do you want to know how planetary transit affect predictions for you & what to do to benefit from planetary transits? Read when do planet transits happen and how would planet transit today affect you. These planetary transits affect predictions to a large extent. Each planet when transits in a sign changes the behaviour and thus each planetary transit affects predictions.</p>
            <p>All results, as indicated in a birth chart, fructify during the Mahadasha and Antardasha of the relevant planets. The Mahadasha sets up a broad background, whereas the Antardashas of various planets during that Mahadasha further pinpoint the type and timing of results. So this is how transit of planets affect prediction.</p>
            <h2>Planetary transit today</h2>
            <p>As all the planets transit regularly, there may be some or the other transit after a few days.  One can know about planetary transit today from different astrology websites. The Mahadasha lasting over a longer time sets up a broad time frame in which the Antar Dasha narrow down the results and their timing. So people who read planetary transit today regularly benefit most from these planetary transits.The transit of planets during the Dashas further narrows down the probability of expected results. The approximate time taken by each planet for transiting through a sign is given in the table below. But still, to know planetary transit today, one can find from good astrology website.</p>

            <h2>How do we read, know about PlanetaryTransit</h2>
            <p>Planetary transits are generally seen as per the Moon sign. For more in-depth analysis, these can also be seen as per the ascendant (Lagna)</p>
            <p>Transits of slow-moving planets viz. Saturn transits, Jupiter transits Rahu Transits, and Ketu transits carry more importance</p>
            <p>The transiting Rahu/Ketu axis can indicate the areas of concern during their transit. For example, this axis falling over 1st and 7th houses will require attention to general health, dealings, marriage and spouse, partnership business, etc.</p>
            <p>Transit of Jupiter is considered for the fructification of auspicious or favourable results. Jupiter transit happening over a house or even over its lord placed elsewhere tends to give favourable results of that house.</p>
            <p>Transit of Saturn over a house or its Lord may not always be malefic, but it may tend to cause concern or delays in fructification of the relevant results</p>
            <p>Transit of Saturn and Rahu combined over a house, or its lord is believed to activate some Karmic work out of accumulated Karma. These results can be good or bad depending upon the condition of these two planets in the actual birth chart of the native.</p>
