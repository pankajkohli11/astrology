            <p><b>Vedic Astrology:</b> It is called 'Vedic Astrology' because it is known to have originated from the 'Vedas.' The astrology study involves stars, sun, moon, and all the nine planets in the solar system. It is based on the belief that these celestial bodies' movements impact the human body and its surroundings.!</p>
            <h2>What are 12 houses in horoscope/birth chart</h2>
            <p>Each horoscope has 12 houses which divide the total birth chart for the different aspects/traits of a person's life. All these 12 houses in a horoscope get some planets in each of these houses and since all planets keep moving(rotating) some slow, some fast, each house gets some planets. This depends on the date, time, and place of birth of the person which house gets what planets. Many people err saying that place of birth does not affect the position of planets in the different houses. They are wrong as each place gets Sun and Moon at different times. Therefore, to read the results of houses in precision, we need to use accurate date, time, and place of birth.</p>
            <p>Now there are 12 houses but only nine planets in astrology. Therefore, some of the houses are likely to remain empty, and also some houses can have multiple planets. It all depends on the position of planets in the Sky at the time of your birth.</p>
            <p>Each 12 houses in Astrology in your horoscope represent different traits and aspects of your life. The results of these 12 houses in a horoscope depend on the position of all nine planets at the time of person's birth. Position of planet in different 12 houses in horoscope infuses the energies of that planet into the particular house. And this decide what will be results on the different traits of person's life based on these 12 kundli houses.</p>
            <p>There are 12 zodiac signs included in it—Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Libra, Virgo, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. Besides, there are five elements—Earth (Bhumi), water (Jala), Fire (Agni), air (Vaayu), and sky (Aakash)—in nature, as explained in the Vedas. The astrologers ponder over these elements while checking the native's horoscope.</p>
            <p>The different Vedic Astrology houses explain and divide the areas of a native's life, depending on his horoscope, which is determined based on the native's accurate location and time and date of birth. The noticeable thing is that different houses rule different areas of one's life.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, they are not as same as the zodiacal wheel. All these houses are linked with a different sign. Each one indicates a specific part of one's life. Now, I will explain about all these 12 houses in astrology in a horoscope with the main area of person's life that each house impacts.</p>
            <h2>What are 12 houses in astrology?</h2>
            <p>Now I will explain what are the 12 houses in astrology. What these 12 houses in astrology represent in a person's life. What stage and age of a person's life these 12 houses in astrology assume the significance.</p>
            <p>1st House: Also known as ‘Ascendant’ or ‘Lagna,’ it is the house of self as it is a clear indication of you—the way you look. It includes your overall personality—childhood, body frame, physical appearance, nature, temperament, nature, health, ego, and sense of self.</p>
