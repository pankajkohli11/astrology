            <p>The word Puja refers to worshipping God. India is considered to be the nation of festivals. Almost every day, there is a celebration of any festival. But, do you know why people keep fast? Have you wondered why so many fasts are kept? Come, today, I will tell you what these fasts are and why they are important.</p>
            <h2>What is the importance of Fasting?</h2>
            <p>When one sacrifices food and water in order to attain any special purpose, it is known as Fast. If a man has virtues, he will attain success and happiness. And if a Man has sinful conduct, he will remain sad and awful. However, every living being in this world wishes to attain happiness according to their convenience and also wish to recover from adverse sorrow.</p>
            <p>After knowing the situation of Human Civilization, the various prestigious and renowned Sages have already explained in Veda Purana, Smritis, and texts the various solutions in order to inculcate happiness and peace and also show ways to get rid of the sorrows in order to uplift the Human Civilization. Amongst all other solutions, fast appears to be the most important solution among the rest.</p>
            <p>Though all standard texts as per Hindu astrology describe Yoga as being based on fundamental principles, different texts interpret a given yoga differently. There are certain yogas, which do not occur as per certain texts. These mainly relate to Mercury and Venus with respect to the planet Sun, the most significant planet as per Hindu Astrology. The Saraswati Yoga is the most common and auspicious according to sacred texts.</p>
            <h2>How do Yoga in a chart give results?</h2>
            <p>Yoga in a birth chart can be seen at the time of birth of a person. These Yoga in horoscope come from the various combinations as explained above and mostly these Yogas are a result of person's past life(s). Once any Yoga gets formed or appear in your horoscope, you cannot change it. Yoga in a horoscope can be both bad and good. Yoga does not mean only good Yoga but can be bad Yogas also. But how to get the results depend on how do you negotiate your "free will" in the present life. "Free will" is your Karmas of present life and it is in your hands to activate good yogas to get best results from them. Same way, it depends on your karmas how to keep the bad Yoga in your birth chart pacified or de-activated.</p>
            <p>One should never get papmered seeing auspicious Yogas in a horoscope. The same way, negative Yoga (Dosha) cannot keep a person cursed throughout the life. Take a small example: A good Pitra dosha can become Pitra Yoga if you are able to take care of your parents, grand parents and try to accomplish their unfufilled tasks. But a good Pitra Yoga can become worst Pitra Dosha if you disrespect your grandparents, parents and elders in the family inspite the fact you perform hefty rituals during Pitra Paksha.</p>
            <p>All Yogas in Horoscope good or bad come from your own deeds of previous births. How to draw results from these Yoga in your birth chart therefore, depend on how do you negotiate free will in the present life. Any Yoga in horoscope and its results have a direct relationship with your  Karmas. Performing only rituals to overcome the negative yogas(doshas) do not and cannot absolve you.</p>
            <h2>Number and effects</h2>
            <p>Yogs are generally classified into six main categories – Chandra (Moon), Surya (Sun), Nabhasa (Celestial), Raja, Dhana or Daridra. The result that a Yog has on an individual’s horoscope is determined by the circumstances of his birth as well as what happens along the course of life, between his birth and death.</p>
