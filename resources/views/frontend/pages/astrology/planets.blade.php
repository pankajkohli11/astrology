            <p>All planets in the constellation be it Inner or Outer have almost equal impact on all the living creatures (bodies) on this earth. Each planet has its own significations & recognition to cover and impact different areas on the earth based on their gravitational forces and rays. Each planet has different gravitational values at the date, time and place of a personâ€™s birth. Accordingly, the impact of each planet will be different in each house of a birth chart. The position of these planets in different houses can be good , bad or even neutral also.</p>
                <h2>Effect of Planets in different houses and signs in Astrology </h2>
            <p>Mostly people start seeing the effects of planets in different houses and signs in Astrology with an eye on negatively placed planets. Next can be the step to suggest rituals to overcome the expected harmful effects of these planets.</p>
            <p>My method & perception regarding these planets in a birth chart is a little different. You see, the particular placement of any planet in a specific house and sign in Astrology depends on the person's previous life(s) deeds. Almighty releases the horoscope to a person on a particular date, time, and place of birth & it all is a direct manifesto & crux of the balance sheet of a person's past life deeds. </p>
            <h2>How do planets behave in different houses and signs in Astrology</h2>
            <p>Planets' behaviour and effect depend on what you did in the past life(s), but then the same Almighty gives you a free will also to handle all such effects through your refined Karmas in the present life. So don't worry about how planets behave; focus on what you should do to keep the behaviour and effects of these planets in different houses of your sign. </p>
            <p>1. You did bad karmas; you get bad planetary combinations.</p>
            <p>2. You did righteous Karmas; you get favorable planetary combinations.</p>
            <p>3. The most important thing to know is that each horoscope has both negative and positive planets, so nothing to feel sad or blessed either way.</p>
            <p>4. Another fact here is that none: be negative or positive planets of planetary combinations, none give you results automatically either way. You have free will, which decides how do you encash or lose on these planetary positions.</p>
            <p>5. Finally, there are planetary transits that play a significant role in changing the effects of these planets in different houses and signs.</p>
            <h2>Results of planets in different signs as per Astrology</h2>
            <p>A sign can be a moon sign or sun sign. For Indian Vedic astrology, more weightage is given to Moon Sign for better accuracy. A sign is ascertained based on the date, time, and place of birth of a person based on set rules of astrology. As explained earlier this all geometry is a direct result of a person's deeds of previous birth(s). Therefore, one planet can be good for one sign and the worst for another sign. Why because the allocation of planets in a particular sign directly results from one's own karmas. It is not the planet that changes its natural results, but it is the particular sign which is responsible as to what type of results it will get from a planet.</p>
            <h2>Can any house in horoscope be most important?</h2>
            <p>This is also a very illogical but very frequently asked question: can any astrology house be most important OR out of the 12 houses in horoscope, can any house be less or more important. No, all houses in your birth chart are inter-related to support other houses. But yes their importance can be different at the different phases of person's life.
