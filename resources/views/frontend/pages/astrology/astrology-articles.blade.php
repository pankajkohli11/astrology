            <p>Vedic Astrology as an ancient science seems losing its value for two reasons:- <br>
                1.Many astrologers still practice it on orthodox methods without making it compatible to dynamics of times. <br>
                2. We see astrology as a science of rituals and not karmic way. </p>
                <h2>How astrology articles can help you?</h2>
            <p>We generally hear people blaming Kundli Dosha or (Kundli Dosh) for every failure and shortcoming in life. Whatever bad or undesired happens in life, the cause is comfortably shifted to kundli dosha that might or might not present in a person’s kundli. What actually these kundli doshas are? Do they really affect you in a bad manner all the time? It is very important to find out whether the kundli doshas are actually present in the kundli or have just been forced by a not so learned astrologer or Pandit Ji. There are varied tales to narrate by the experts about the Janam Kundli Dosha and their repercussions in the native’s life. But one needs to go deeper to get a clear glimpse of kundli doshas. Read further to know the relevance, types, general effects and effective remedies of doshas in a kundli.</p>
            <p><strong>What is Kundli Dosha and how does it Form in a Birth Chart?&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A dosha as we understand in general terms is a flaw or shortcoming in something desirable. A Janam Kundli Dosha shows a lack of something. For e.g. a native may lack marital bliss or a stable career or good health or anything. All these flaws can be attributed as doshas in kundli. Not only this, but when we don’t get the desired results even after putting best of our efforts or face frequent failures in life, then also the underlying cause is kundli dosha.</li>
                <li>There is no person on this Earth whose kundli is free from any kind of dosha. So, there is nothing to fear about and what matters is the intensity of these doshas in the kundli. One may easily check online kundli by providing basic birth details at the website.</li>
                <li>A kundli dosha is simply a malefic placement of the planets in a birth chart. Whenever any planet is under the influence of malefic planets like Rahu, Ketu, Saturn and Mars then a dosha is formed in our kundli</li>
                <li>A kundli dosha is also formed due to the placement of the planets in bad or trik houses. However, kundli dosha can be formed through the placement in Kendra or trikona houses as well depending upon the planet and associated influence. For e.g. Mars placed in the fourth house i.e. a Kendra house forms mangal dosha in a native’s kundli.</li>
                <li>A kundli dosha can be formed through any means and the learned astrologer has to check the gravity because sometimes a dosha is ineffective to render bad results.</li>
