            <h2><strong>Your horoscope for next week&nbsp;â€“ Weekly Horoscopes</strong></h2>
            <p>Weekly horoscope predictions play a crucial role in helping a person plan some events that will happen in the immediate future like business changes, change in job, making investment plans, buying and selling property, and taking care of expected issues in the health, planning business travel.

            <p>There are many things in our daily lives when we plan to apply for a new job, plan an outstation trip, plan to make investments, or visit a doctor for health check-ups. Sometimes we, out of compulsions or out of attitude, defer such actions.

            <p>Reading your horoscope for next week does not need any commitment from you.

So reading your horoscope based on these Vedic Weekly astrology for predictions for next week helps you manage some of your actions for sure in a particular week or defer for some weeks.</p>
            <h2><strong>How are weekly horoscopes different from daily horoscopes?</strong></h2>
            <p>Weekly horoscopes are different from Daily horoscopes, mainly on one factor: the movement of planets known as&nbsp;<strong>"planetary transits".</strong>&nbsp;During these transits, one particular planet leaves one sign and enters the next sign. Some fast-moving planets like Sun &amp; Mercury change the sign after 30 days, Mars and Venus within 23 to 60 days. But each week, we have the transit of some or the other planet, and all these transits have a vast changing impact on all moon signs. Reading your horoscope for next week helps you to understand the impact of such transits on you. There are many good websites for these Weekly astrology &amp; you read your horoscope for next week from any of these good sources. Here you will find if in one week they advise you some do's, in weekly horoscopes of a few weeks later, it will suggest you don'ts for the same act.&nbsp;</p>
            <h2><strong>Indian Weekly astrology&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>
            <p>What is Indian Weekly astrology &amp; how is this different from a normal &amp; regular Vedic astrology. You may be surprised that the experts offering Vedic Weekly astrology can be different from a normal astrologer. Considering planetary transits in weekly horoscopes, Indian Weekly astrology becomes a much exhaustive subject than a normal astrology website because it has to study the planetary transits which is not an easy job. But yes one you get attached to a good source of Weekly Astrology, you will get a much better and broader guideline for you to plan your actions for your next week. But daily horoscopes are based on the daily movement of the planets thus, the thought process going into the daily horoscopes will be much narrower compared to weekly horoscopes. And since the sources of Indian Weekly Astrology offering free weekly horoscopes needs a much wider astrological analysis than the free daily horoscopes, you will find the sources/websites offering free Weekly horoscopes are much lesser than the websites offering free daily horoscopes. Because it needs the source to spend more time on reading about the impact of the planet's transits before giving you suggestions on free weekly horoscopes.</p>
