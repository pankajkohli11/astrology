            <p><strong>Horoscope</strong> is a definite document allotted to a person at the time of birth. It is based on the <strong>date, time &amp; place of birth</strong> of a person. It is not an arbitrary or random script but is a direct manifesto of our previous birth. Horoscope is fixed, and no one, including the creator of it Brahma, can change it. Then how do astrologers or <strong>astrology</strong> help us reading horoscope? And what is right way of reading the horoscope?&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Horoscope is an authentic document to reflect your past, present, and future life. It helps to identify challenges, obstructions, opportunities, and all that will come your way in the present life.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>It is a detailed insight into the World of <strong>Vedic astrology</strong> to tell how it affects your lives and its multiple aspects. The horoscope analysis by <strong>Dr. Vinay Bajrangi provides daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly horoscope predictions.&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>Horoscope is also known as birth chart, natal chart, kundli, and Janam kundali and may even have some different words in regional languages. Whatever be the name, horoscope/birth chart is the foundation of Vedic Astrology. It represents the position of planets, nakshatras at the time and date of birth in one's birth chart.</p>
            <p><strong>Importance of horoscope – birth chart&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>What is the significance of horoscope &amp; what purpose it serves? Horoscope reflects what you did in the previous birth, what good or bad you will get in the present life. A proper reading of the horoscope lets a person know about one's deeds of previous birth and what a person will get in the present life. Horoscope focuses on letting a person learn from the previous life&nbsp;to manage "free will" in the present birth. A horoscope lets a person know the purpose of present birth in this World. So what you did, you know, what you are supposed to do, and how you will achieve what you want to achieve is the <strong>importance of horoscope/birth chart</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>You can read my latest interview on 'Importance of Horoscope' and 'Relevance of daily horoscope in today’s times'&nbsp;in Outlook India/The Weeks/ Hindustan Times also in our News section below.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
            <h2><strong>How to read a birth chart – horoscope?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
            <p>Predictive Astrology is an astronomical science about total planetary placements &amp; combinations which incorporates both positive and negative effects of constellations and planets on a native. Reading of horoscope means co-relating all the planetary position with a person's earlier lives&nbsp;&amp; then understanding why it has got negative &amp; positive planets &amp; planetary combinations. A detailed study is carried out in order to give out suggestive predictions.</p>
            <p>There are <strong>twelve Zodiac Signs</strong> in the constellation &amp; all humans fall in any one of these twelve Zodiac Signs. These twelve zodiac signs are broadly categorised into four elements based on each element's overall <strong>traits and characteristics</strong>. These elements are – Fire, Water, Earth &amp; Air. Now, like twelve Zodiacs, there are twelve (bhava) in a horoscope. Reading of horoscope means understanding the intrinsic relationship of all these three factors, their impact, and their influence on a person's life.</p>
            <h2><strong>What are these twelve (houses) bhava in a horoscope?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>1st house</strong> – it is also called as Lagna Bhava. Ascendant, D-1 Chart. Its significator is Sun &amp; it represents the person him/herself, body, head, ego. It further represents self-expression, personality, body, and physical traits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>2nd house</strong> – it is also known as Dhan Bhava. Its significator is planet Jupiter, representing financial status through career, speech, expression power, career, livelihood, and preferences.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>3rd House</strong> – It is also known as Bratru Bhava. Mars being its significator, it represents interest, power, motivation, brother, intention, will power, friends. It also represents zeal, impulsiveness, hobbies, ambition &amp; life energy.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>4th House</strong> – We also call it Sukha Bhava. Moon being its significator, it represents mind, emotions, happiness. It also represents education, property, land acquisition, recognition, and relaxation,&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>5th House</strong> – We also know it as Putra Bhava. With Jupiter being its significator, it represents intelligence, education, creative abilities, children. It also represents past life effects, romance, games, speculation, and spiritual practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
